Play Experience
This experience does not entail our whole game yet, but it has a few of the
fundamental bones that form it. Right now, we have the grabbing system working
and one tool that interacts with one ingredient...all inside an estimated greybox of the environment.

We're aiming to gauge the feel of the physics and controls in an environment...how it feels to grab things, move things, and use the tools developed so far. Does the play align with our pillars? Does play
match the feeling we're trying to go for?

LIST OF BUGS:
- Player can clip through geometry
- Players can grip onto the same grip points as each other
- Players can move infinitely far
